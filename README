****** DESCRIPTION ******

This is a UISlider subclass that is compatiable with iPad. The class adds a UIPopover to the slider that displays the value currently selected by the slider. The classes SliderValueViewController is meant to be modified to meet an applications specific needs.

This fork allows develoeprs to instantiate the UISlider sublcass programatically (not from a nib). I did this to use it in a UITableViewCell. I also wanted the popover displaying the value to disappear as soon as the user let you, since the table view in question was itself in a popover and this isn't INCEPTION.

****** HOW TO USE ******

Simply place a UISlider in a XIB and change its class to be an ELCSlider. That is it, you're done!
